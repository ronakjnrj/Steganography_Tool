 # Steganography_Tool 

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) 

**An image steganography tool for secure, covert communication.** 

This project provides a user-friendly interface and robust algorithms to embed secret data within digital images. By subtly modifying pixel values, it allows you to conceal sensitive information without causing any noticeable change to the image's visual appearance. This ensures a secure and discreet method for data transmission and enhances digital privacy. 
  
**Key Features:**

* **Secure Data Embedding:** Utilizes steganographic techniques to hide data effectively within images.
* **Covert Communication:** Enables discreet transfer of information, undetectable by casual observation.
* **Preserves Image Integrity:** Algorithms are designed to minimize visual distortion of the carrier image.
* **Supports [Mention Supported Image Formats, e.g., PNG, BMP]**: Compatible with common image file formats. 
* **[Optional: Mention Specific Algorithms Used, e.g., LSB (Least Significant Bit)]**: Employs [Algorithm Name] for embedding and extraction.
* **User-Friendly Interface [If applicable]**: Provides an intuitive way to embed and extract data. 
* **Data Protection & Digital Privacy:** Offers a method to protect sensitive information during transmission or storage.
 
**Getting Started:** 
 
[Include instructions on how to download, install, and run the tool. This might involve:]

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd Steganography_Tool
    ```
2.  **Installation (if necessary, e.g., for dependencies):**
    ```bash
    # Example for Python:
    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Running the tool:**
    ```bash
    # Example for a Python script:
    # python main.py
    ```
    ```bash
    # Example for an executable:
    # ./steganography_tool
    ```

**Usage:**

[Provide clear instructions on how to use the tool for both embedding and extracting data. Include examples if possible.]

* **Embedding Data:**
    1.  Select the image you want to use.
    2.  Enter the secret data you wish to embed.
    3.  [Mention any options, e.g., choose an algorithm, set a password].
    4.  Initiate the embedding process.
    5.  Save the resulting image.

* **Extracting Data:**
    1.  Select the image containing the hidden data.
    2.  [Mention any required information, e.g., enter the password if used].
    3.  Initiate the extraction process.
    4.  View the extracted secret data.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Image Size:** The amount of data you can embed depends on the size and format of the image. Larger images generally allow for more hidden data.
* **Data Security:** While steganography provides a layer of secrecy, it's not a replacement for strong encryption. For highly sensitive data, consider combining steganography with encryption.
* **Detection Risks:** Sophisticated steganalysis techniques exist that can potentially detect hidden data.
